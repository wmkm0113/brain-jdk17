The development team takes security bugs in the current project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue or security bugs in third-party modules, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/wmkm0113/brain-jdk17/security/advisories/new) tab.

The development team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
